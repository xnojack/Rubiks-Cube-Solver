# Sample Output for GA
This folder contains a sample output for running the `GA Multi Core.py`. In the data folder you'll find 2 csvs, the raw csv contains each run with generation min, max and avergae, while the avg file contains an avergae of the min, max and average for all 10 runs.

The picture folder contains pictures of graphs of the initial and final population of each run, along with an average of the min, max and average of each generation over all 10 runs.

The `output.txt` file contains the raw output of the script. Every 10 generations the generation number is printed along with the current `currentMax` value. At the end of the run the closest/best solution is printed.
